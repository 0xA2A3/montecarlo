# montecarlo
Can you break the bank at Monte Carlo?

## Purpose and Scope
In the Preface to *Fooled by Randomness*, Nassim Nicholas Taleb states:

> There are many intellectual approaches to probability and risk â€” "probability" means slightly different things to people in different disciplines. In this book it is tenaciously qualitative and literary as opposed to quantitative and "scientific" (which explains the warnings against economists and finance professors as they tend to firmly believe that they know something, and something useful at that). It is presented as flowing from Hume's Problem of Induction (or Aristotle's inference to the general) as opposed to the paradigm of the gambling literature.

This project is of "the paradigm of the gambling literature". At the very least, we use "games of chance" as experimental forays. Probability theory was arguably born out of gamblers' whims as related to these "games of chance". Other approaches to probability (such as that of and from logic) are perhaps "easier" to understand. But this project's main purpose is to help understand basic probability, and allow the unintuitive become more intuitive.

## Personal Notes
Developing this to learn:
* software development (whatever that is);
* probability theory;
* statistics;
* gambling theory;

and ideas surrounding **randomness**.

I know nothing more than I know. And even less of the things I know not.
